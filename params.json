Though simple, it's used as both a front-facing website about me and a showcase of the various technologies I have experience with. For example, the page you're currently viewing demonstrates that I use version control. And although I prefer git/GitHub, I have also worked with Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Subversion (SVN).\r\n\r\n### Technology Showcase\r\nTo date, the website currently demonstrates the following:\r\n\r\n* .NET Framework v4.5.1 (using C#)\r\n* ASP.NET MVC5 (via Razor pages)\r\n* NuGet Package Restore\r\n\r\nAs the site grows I will add to this list (and hopefully cite the sources of these implementations for easy reference.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCurrently it's just me (@bchristie) but I'd love to see other contributors implementing other components and, of course, fixing my mistakes.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nNeed to contact me? Feel free to drop my a line via contact [at] bradachristie [dot] info.\r\n\r\n  [home]: http://bradachristie.info","google":"UA-31879852-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
